We will create Controllers using Grails Scaffolding. This will allow us to generate a CRUD interface with minimal programming.

[source, bash]
----
> grails create-controller Student
----

[source, bash]
----
> grails create-controller Classroom
----

Add the scaffolding property to the Controllers.

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/controllers/grails/mock/basics/StudentController.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/controllers/grails/mock/basics/StudentController.groovy[indent=0]
----
[source, groovy]
.grails-app/controllers/grails/mock/basics/ClassroomController.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/controllers/grails/mock/basics/ClassroomController.groovy[indent=0]
----

At this stage, you are ready to run the application to make sure coding so far is on track. Make sure you are still in the `initial` folder.

[source, bash]
----
> grails run-app
----

The application should run at localhost:8080. You should be able to perform basic CRUD operations on `Student` and `Classroom`.
