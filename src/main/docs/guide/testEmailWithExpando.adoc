Another approach to mocking is with Groovy's Expando() class. Expando() is a map implementation which gives the ability to create a mock object with a simple closure. There are no built in verifications, but it allows a simply way to mock out a dependency so you can focus what is under test.

<1> Mock domain classes
<2> Create an Expando for the mock.
<3> Implement the method with simple closure.
