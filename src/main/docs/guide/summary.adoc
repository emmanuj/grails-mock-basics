To summarize this guide:

- To unit test Service's methods with GORM code, use `HibernateSpec`
- To create an integration tests for a service, inject the service with `@Autowired`
-  Mocking Services can be done with the Spock `Mock()` method. It abides by lenient mock principles, and comes with an array of verification features.
-  `Expando()` is a plain mocking approach available offered by Groovy.
