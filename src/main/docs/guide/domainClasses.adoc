We will create Domain classes that serve as the basis for the application. The `Student` and `Classroom` have a one-to-many relationship, where the `Classroom` holds many `Student`(s).
A `Student` can be enrolled in one `Classroom` or none.

[source, bash]
----
> grails create-domain-class Student
----

Add domain properties to the created class file.

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/domain/grails/mock/basics/Student.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/domain/grails/mock/basics/Student.groovy[indent=0]
----

[source, bash]
----
> grails create-domain-class Classroom
----

Again, add domain properties to the created class file. This time note that Classroom `hasMany` Students. This creates the one-to-many relationship.

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/domain/grails/mock/basics/Classroom.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/domain/grails/mock/basics/Classroom.groovy[indent=0]
