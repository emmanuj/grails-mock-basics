Another approach to mocking is with Groovy's Expando() class. Expando() is a map implementation which give the ability to create a mock object with a simple closure. There are no built in verifications, but it allows a simply way to mock out a dependency so you can focus what is under test.

[source, groovy]
.src/test/groovy/grails/mock/basics/ClassroomServiceSpec.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/test/groovy/grails/mock/basics/ClassroomServiceSpec.groovy[tags=testEmailExpando]
----

Execute the test command to view the test results.

[source,groovy]
----
grails test-app
----

<1> Create an Expando for the mock.
<2> Implement the method with simple closure.
