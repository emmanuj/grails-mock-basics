We could unit test a project query with a unit test. See:

`.src/test/groovy/grails/mock/basics/ClassroomServiceSpec.groovy`

However, you may want to use an integration test. For example, you may want to test the query against the same database which you use in production.

Just use `@Autowired` to inject your service into your integration tests as displayed below:

[source, groovy]
.src/integration-test/groovy/grails/mock/basics/ClassroomServiceIntegrationSpec.groovy

include::{sourceDir}/src/integration-test/groovy/grails/mock/basics/ClassroomServiceIntegrationSpec.groovy[indent=0]
