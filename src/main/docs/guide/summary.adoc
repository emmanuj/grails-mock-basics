- To unit test Service's methods with GORM code, use `HibernateSpec`.
- To create an integration tests for a service, inject the service with `@Autowired`.
- Mocking Services can be done with the Spock `Mock()` method. It abides by lenient mock principles, and comes with an array of features.
- `Expando()` is a plain mocking approach offered by Groovy.
